    [2] Model a classroom using one wall whose visible surface is the z = 0 plane, (where the blackboard will be attached), and a planar floor with the y-axis as its normal.
- Done

    [2] Model and position a blackboard. It should be planar and in the y-x plane. When the blackboard is positioned on the wall, its geometric center should be at the origin of the world coordinate system, <0, 0, 0>.
- Done


    [2] You should be able to read arbitrary splines and project them on the blackboard.
- Done

    [5] Model a human character using ellipses (see figure).
- Done

    [10] Implement an inverse kinematics solver using the pseudo-inverse approach. If you get stuck here/run out of time/can not complete the solver for whatever reason, you may use the Jacobian Transpose or the Cyclic Coordinate Descent method for a maximum of 5 points. You must identify exactly the approach you took in the required readme file [-5 if you do not].
- I attempted to use the Jacobian transpose method, but I could not get it implemented properly. I am disappointed too.

    [1] Draw the spline on the board.
- Done

    [2] The character should start in the rest pose. After a spline is loaded, the character should switch to the Ready pose (see below) for drawing on the blackboard.
- Done

    [1] Follow the interface elements specified below.
- Done
